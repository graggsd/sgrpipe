# sgrpipe

The goal of sgrpipe is to facilitate a simple R analysis pipeline. Currently,
the function of most use is run_R, which will either source `.R` scritps 
or compile `.Rmd` files. The point is to place a series of `run_R` calls 
pointing to scripts in your pipeline such that they may be interactively 
launched when running/testing your pipeline. After the end of each call, 
all variables are removed from the global environment.

## Installation

You can install sgrpipe from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("graggsd/sgrpipe")
```
